# Alibis_Exercise

This small exercise was done with TypeScript and Node.js. Unfortunatly, the code shown is not 100% functional as there is a problem with registering multiple activities for the suspect.

How to start the program:
- npm i --peer-legacy-deps;
- npm run build;
- npm start.

What to Expect?
 The code successfully determines if the suspect has an alibi or not if only inserted one activity, there are flaws in the code as this was just an exercise for me to refine my skills and learn.
 The program will function in the console, where inputs are expected.
